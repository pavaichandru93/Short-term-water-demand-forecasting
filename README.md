# Long-term-water-demand-forecasting
The overall objective of this research is twofold, on one hand, the objective is that of analyzing the usage of innovative deep neural networks to predict water demand, compared to traditional models, identifying advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, the objective is that of analyze the results and benefits of considering external factors when generating forecasts (eg. weather conditions, public events)
